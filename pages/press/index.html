        GoCardless makes Direct Debit simple
      </h3>
      <p class="para">
        Taking payments should be simple, but it's not. Suppliers of goods and services are forced to pay high credit card fees, or else risk waiting unpaid for months.
      </p>
      <p class="para">
        For any business taking recurring payments or invoicing – from accountants to train companies – Direct Debit is the only payment system that puts them in control of when they’re paid. But the system is exclusive and complex to manage.
      </p>
      <p class="para">
        GoCardless exists to change this. There are no barriers, no exclusivity, and no complex payment processes. GoCardless puts business’ payments and cash flow under their control.
      </p>

        Our story
      </h3>
      <p class="para">
        GoCardless was founded in January 2011 by Tom Blomfield, Matt Robinson and Hiroki Takeuchi.
      </p>

      <p class="para">
        Breaking out of their jobs as financial consultants, they started a business. But taking payments soon became a difficult and expensive nightmare. They wanted to use Direct Debit to control regular payments, but the banks slammed the door on them.
      </p>

      <p class="para">
        The three set out to make it easy for businesses to take Direct Debit payments. Enter, GoCardless.
      </p>

      <p class="para">
        GoCardless now serves more businesses than any other Direct Debit provider. Customers include <a href="/stories/greater-anglia">Greater Anglia Trains</a> and Rock Choir. The company is authorised by the Financial Conduct Authority.
