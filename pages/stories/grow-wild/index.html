        Challenge
      </h3>
      <div class="section-subheading">
      “We were spending at least 10 hours a week on payments”
      </div>
      <p class="para">
        Grow Wild is a veg box company established in 1998.  Until last year they were reliant on traditional payment collection methods such as cheques, cash and cards.  “This was extremely time consuming; we were spending at least 10 hours a week manually entering payments, chasing late payments and trying to update expired card details.”
      </p>

      <h3 class="section-heading">
        Solution
      </h3>
      <div class="section-subheading">
      “I couldn’t believe collecting payments could be so simple”
      </div>
      <p class="para">
       They started to think that Direct Debit might be the solution but were put off by the expense involved.  “We chose GoCardless based on a recommendation from Dogmoor, another GoCardless customer.  They said it’s simple and easy and brilliant so we looked into it.  I couldn’t believe collecting payments could be so simple.” Now 98% of Grow Wild’s customers pay through GoCardless.

        Benefits
      </h3>
      <div class="section-subheading">
      “Processing payments takes 5 minutes rather than 3 ½ hours”
      </div>
      <p class="para">
        The main benefit for Lindsay has been the reduced admin time.  “Before using GoCardless we were spending over ten hours a week managing the payment process. Now processing payments takes 5 minutes rather than 3 and a half hours.  This frees me up to focus on diversifying and expanding the business. I can be more strategic and less operational.”
      </p>
      <p class="para">
        Grow Wild have found GoCardless incredibly easy to use. Lindsay explained that “it is incredibly easy for our customers to see what payments are going out.  It’s also a great reference for us.  If customers have queries we can go straight to GoCardless to see what’s what.”
