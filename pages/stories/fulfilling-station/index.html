        Challenge
      </h3>
      <div class="section-subheading">
      “More than half of our customers were paying late”
      </div>
      <p class="para">
        <%= link_to "The Fulfilling Station", "http://www.thefulfillingstation.co.uk",:rel => 'nofollow' %> is a third-party fulfilment company, offering logistics services, managed warehousing and storage. Before switching to GoCardless, the company was plagued by payment issues, with customers frequently forgetting to pay.

      <p class="para">
        “The traditional methods of cheques, cash and standing orders weren't working. More than half of our customers were paying late and we were owed over £100,000 per month. Our accounts team were spending over 10 hours a week just chasing late payments,” explained Director Martin Parfrey.
      </p>

      </div>
      <p class="para">
        The Fulfilling Station now allows customers to pay using Direct Debit with GoCardless. “GoCardless offered amazing value for money and the integration with Sage means our payments can be automatically reconciled into our accounts.”
