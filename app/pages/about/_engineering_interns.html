<p class="para">
  We’re looking for talented, motivated undergrads who want to work on real problems with a world-class team.
</p>

<p class="para">We have paid internships and placements available in our front-end, back-end and web operations teams. If you're passionate about tech, care about learning and finding elegant solutions, and want to work with like-minded engineers, we want to hear from you.
</p>

<h4 class="u-text-s u-margin-Bxs u-margin-Tm">Our team</h4>

<p class="para">GoCardless is an ambitious, fast-growing tech startup disrupting the payments industry. We build simple, reliable systems on top of technologies we understand and trust. We're primarily built in Ruby and JavaScript using Rails and Angular, and we rely on Postgres, Elasticsearch, RabbitMQ and Chef.
</p>

<p class="para">We're nimble, deploying every day, and we're doing our most ambitious work right now – working with government and multi-national companies to build GoCardless Pro, and integrating with more banking systems to expand our offering across Europe.
</p>

<p class="para">At the same time we’re already processing millions of pounds of payments every day, so there's no space for inconsistent data or downtime. We maintain reliability while iterating on our product by having a test-suite we can rely on, and prioritising code review.
</p>

<p class="para">As a dev team, learning and mentoring are core to our values: we send our team to conferences and run internal talks on subjects both technical and general. We’re involved in the wider tech community too, regularly hosting meetups and hackdays, and speaking at external events to share our knowledge, skills and passion.
</p>

</p>
 
<p class="para">You’ll also get an insight into how a fast-growing tech company works and how the different areas of our business interact.
