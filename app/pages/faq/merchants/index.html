          <li><strong>Our clean, RESTful API</strong> - Integrate GoCardless into your website using our <a href="https://developer.gocardless.com/">REST API</a>.</li>

        <h3 class="section-heading">What can I not use GoCardless for?</h3>
        <p class="para">GoCardless is great for many use cases. However, there are some limitations with our service. We aren't able to:</p>
        <ul class="list">
          <li><b>Let you take credit card payments</b> - however you <strong>can</strong> use another payment provider alongside GoCardless.</li>
          <li><b>Let you accept instant payments</b> - Direct Debit payments take 3-5 working days to clear, so they're not ideal for goods that need
            to be shipped quickly.</li>
          <li><b>Let you accept payments from non-UK bank accounts</b> - Soon, we'll
            be available across the EU, and then further afield.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para">We're able to accept most kinds of customers but there are some exceptions - for full details, see our <a href="/legal/restrictions">restricted activities page</a>.</p>

      <article class="tab-pane" id="signing-up-tab">
        <h3 class="section-heading">What do I need to sign up?</h3>
        <p class="para">We will need some personal details to help us verify your identity and some basic information on the company or organisation you are collecting for.</p>

        <h3 class="section-heading">How do I test out the product?</h3>

        <p class="para">Yes - GoCardless is available to charities, registered companies and individuals.</p>

      <article class="tab-pane" id="direct-debit-tab">
        <h3 class="section-heading">What is the Direct Debit Guarantee?</h3>
        <a href="https://gocardless.com/direct-debit/guarantee/">Debit Guarantee</a> offers protection to customers paying by Direct Debit in the rare event that there is an error in a payment.
        <p class="para">If a customer receives a refund they are not entitled to, they must pay it back at the organisation's request. Dispute resolution takes place outside of the Direct Debit scheme.</p>

        <p class="para">There is no need to talk to your bank either. We provide you with everything you need to sign up online and start taking payments.</p>

        <hr>
        <h3 class="section-heading">What kind of payments is it good for?</h3>

        <p>They are particularly good for:</p>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>Regular payments (e.g., subscriptions or regular donations)</li>

          <li>High-value, one-off payments for liquid goods (e.g., gold bullion)</li>
          <li>Transactions likely to experience chargebacks (e.g., gambling)</li>
        </ul>

        <hr>
        <h3 class="section-heading">What are the payment timings for Direct Debit?</h3>
        <p class="para">Unlike card payments, Direct Debits don't clear instantly. Instead, it takes 3 days to set up each new payer, and to collect from payers who you currently have a Direct Debit relationship with.</p>
        <p class="para">Once GoCardless has collected payment from your customer we hold the money for 3 working days before sending it directly to your bank account.</p>

        <hr>
        <h3 class="section-heading">Can I collect one-off payments using Direct Debit?</h3>
        <p class="para">Yes - although Direct Debit is most well-known for recurring payments, it can also be used to collect one-off payments.</p>

        <hr>
        <h3 class="section-heading">Can I easily change Direct Debit provider?</h3>
        <p class="para">Yes - the <a href="/direct-debit/transferring/">Direct Debit bulk change</a> process allows you to move Direct Debits between providers easily.</p>
        <p class="para">GoCardless has experience managing the entire transfer process for several large merchants, including Greater Anglia Railways. Your existing customers won't need to take any action whatsoever, and we offer this service free of charge.</p>
      </article>

      <article class="tab-pane" id="international-payments-tab">
        <h3 class="section-heading">Can only UK businesses use GoCardless?</h3>
        <p class="para">No. You just need to have a UK bank account so we can pay you. You do not need to be a UK registered business or individual.</p>

        <hr>
        <h3 class="section-heading">When can I collect from Europe?</h3>
        <p class="para">Anyone with a UK bank account will be able to collect from Europe as soon as we launch our <a href="/europe">SEPA Direct Debit</a> product.</p>
        <p class="para">This is currently in the late stages of development and the first batch of invites will be sent out the next few months. Countries will be phased in according to customer demand so be sure to <a href="/europe">register your interest</a>!</p>
        <p class="para">SEPA Direct Debit is a new payments scheme which allows you to collect from any bank account in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_Euro_Payments_Area">Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA)</a>. It works similarly to Direct Debit in the UK.</p>

        <hr>
        <h3 class="section-heading">Will international payments cost the same as UK?</h3>
        <p class="para">The honest answer is that we don't know. We will be trialling pricing with early users to see what makes most sense for them, and don't want to commit to something now only to change it later.</p>
        <p><strong>We can, however, make a commitment that offering <a href="/pricing">simple, transparent &amp; low fees</a> will remain a priority to us.</strong></p>

        <hr>
        <h3 class="section-heading">When will GoCardless be available outside Europe?</h3>
