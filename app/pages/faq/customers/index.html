            How does GoCardless collect payment from my account?
          </h3>
          <p class="para">GoCardless uses the Direct Debit protocol to collect all payments. This allows us to process payments without using the card networks.</p>
          <p class="para">To collect payment by Direct Debit, GoCardless first sets up a Direct Debit mandate on your account. This mandate is then used to collect the payment you have specified.</p>

            What if my funds don't reach the merchant?
          </h3>
          <p class="para">GoCardless is not aware of any payment ever failing to reach its destination. However, if this were to occur for any reason you would have a right under the <a href="https://gocardless.com/direct-debit/guarantee/" class="u-link-medium-gray u-text-underline">Direct Debit Guarantee</a> to charge back to payment.</p>
