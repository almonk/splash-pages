          <a href="http://www.crowdcube.com" class="u-link-color-p u-text-underline" target="_blank">Crowdcube</a> is the world’s leading investment crowdfunding site. It enables ordinary and professional investors to help entrepreneurs raise the finance they need to grow.

          Before switching to GoCardless, investments were made using bank deposits which were held until the relevant pitch had reached its target. 
        </p>
        <p class="u-color-p u-margin-Tm">
          Darren Westlake, CEO explains: “It wasn’t the most efficient way of doing things. Even though we were still quite small we were spending hours every day managing payments: checking our accounts, aligning statements and customers and moving funds to the relevant pitch.”

          Looking for a more scalable solution Darren turned to Direct Debit with GoCardless.

        <p class="u-color-p">
          He explains, “We chose GoCardless because it let us set up payments without taking any money until the pitch has reached its target meaning we no longer had to spend hours checking accounts. It was simple to integrate into our systems and really intuitive and easy to use for our entrepreneurs and our customers.”
        </p>
        <p class="u-color-p">
          Crowdcube now ask all customers to use GoCardless and each of their entrepreneurs has their own account so payments can be made directly to them.
