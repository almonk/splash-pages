        Challenge
      </h3>
      <div class="section-subheading">
      “Chasing payments was a waste of time”
      </div>
      <p class="para">
        <a href="http://www.zestdigital.co/"$extension>Zest Digital</a> is a  digital marketing agency based in Oxfordshire. By automating processes wherever possible, the company has served hundreds of clients with just a handful of staff. A year ago, MD Alex Minchin realised that an overhaul of their payment process was needed to help them grow.
      </p>

      <p class="para">
      "We used to get paid by manual bank transfers but managing invoices and chasing payments was a waste of time," says Alex. With average debtor days of 76 days, Zest's growth was stifled by poor cashflow and they were unable to hire new staff despite a growing order book.

        Solution
      </h3>
      <div class="section-subheading">
      “GoCardless were by far the best”
      </div>
      <p class="para">
       Alex believed that Direct Debit was the most reliable solution and after considering several Direct Debit providers, selected GoCardless.  "I spoke with a number of Direct Debit providers and GoCardless were by far the best. All the others had large up-front fees and seemed much more difficult to integrate."
      </p>

      <p class="para">
      They now take payments automatically through the Dashboard. The Zest team has also integrated GoCardless with their CRM to automate payment reminders.
