        Challenge

      “Collecting membership fees was difficult and time consuming”
      </div>
      <p class="para">
        <a href="http://hockey.spencerclub.org" rel="nofollow">Spencer Hockey Club</a> is one of the UK's leading hockey clubs. With over 400 players, managing the club was a real challenge for the volunteer committee.  “We used to let members pay however they wanted: monthly, annually, by cheque or bank transfer and with variable additions. It made collecting membership fees difficult and time consuming.”
      </p>
      <p class="para">
        Tracking payments through bank statements "was very painful, and the Club suffered from late payments," says Mark McDermott, club member and Director of <a href="http://www.codegent.com">codegent</a>, who built the site.

        Solution
      </h3>
      <div class="section-subheading">
      “GoCardless felt like an automation of what we were already doing”
      </div>
      <p class="para">
        “We realised we needed an online payment system, but had been put off by other providers' high fees and requirements for a merchant account. GoCardless provided a low cost solution that felt like an automation of what we were already doing."
      </p>

      <p class="para">
        The Club integrated the GoCardless API into their site in one weekend and now use it to take regular and one-off payments from members.

        Benefits
      </h3>
      <div class="section-subheading">
      “The black hole in our finances has disappeared”
      </div>
      <p class="para">
        “Within 8 months of integration, 80% of the team were using GoCardless to make their payments.  As a membership group, there is a high level of trust between us so Direct Debit is a nice fit.”
      </p>

      <p class="para">
        Using GoCardless, the committee considerably reduced the time spent chasing payments, making the Club more financially stable.  “With 80% take-up by our members, the black hole in our finances has disappeared, so now we can spend more time growing our reserves.”
