        Challenge
      </h3>

      “More than half of our customers were paying late”
      </div>
      <p class="para">
        <a href="http://www.thefulfillingstation.co.uk"$extension>The Fulfilling Station</a> is a third-party fulfilment company, offering logistics services, managed warehousing and storage. Before switching to GoCardless, the company was plagued by payment issues, with customers frequently forgetting to pay.
      </p>

      <p class="para">
        “The traditional methods of cheques, cash and standing orders weren't working. More than half of our customers were paying late and we were owed over £100,000 per month. Our accounts team were spending over 10 hours a week just chasing late payments,” explained Director Martin Parfrey.
      </p>
