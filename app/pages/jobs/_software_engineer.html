<h2 class="u-text-h2 u-text-heading">Backend Software Engineer</h2>

<p class="para">
  We're looking for experienced backend software engineers to join our growing team.
</p>

<h4 class="u-text-h4 u-margin-Bxs u-margin-Tm">Our work</h4>
<p class="para">We're building a simple, intuitive system on top of Europe's
  broken payments infrastructure. Thousands of merchants already relying on us
  to collect millions of pounds every day.</p>

<p class="para">As an engineering team, working in payments has important
  repercussions:</p>
<ul class="list">
  <li>Consistency can't be sacrificed. Wonky data is not an option.</li>
  <li>Availability really matters. If we go down thousands of companies are left
    unable to do business.</li>
</ul>

<p class="para">At the same time, we're a startup growing at over 700% a year.
  We're doing our most ambitious work right now to drive that growth:</p>

<ul class="list">
  <li>
    Working with government and multi-national customers to build the next generation of our product.
  </li>
  <li>
    Integrating with new banking systems to expand our offering across Europe.
  </li>
    <li>
    Automating everything from fraud detection to legacy (paper-based) interactions
    with the banks.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 class="u-text-h4 u-margin-Bxs u-margin-Tm">Our culture</h4>
<p class="para">Payments is a scale business with huge returns to great
  engineering. We have a culture where you can do work that you're proud
  of every day.</p>

<p class="para">We're building a huge company, so we invest time in building
  things well. We keep our technical debt low by regularly refactoring and
  improving our architecture. We know how important it is to be able to move
  fast in the future as well as right now.</p>

<p class="para">Despite the scale of our work, we're a small team. We're passionate
  about learning, and we all care deeply about the quality of what we build.
  We regularly run internal tech talks, and you'll often find us at The Old
  King's Head after work still talking about the woes of building distributed
  systems.</p>

<p class="para">As a company we're also active members of the community. We open source
  whatever we can, as we did with <a href="https://github.com/gocardless/hutch">Hutch</a>
  and <a href="https://github.com/gocardless/statesman">Statesman</a>, and we regularly
  host events and meetups. We have a conference budget for all employees and
  offer (optional!) speaker coaching for those who want it.</p>

<h4 class="u-text-h4 u-margin-Bxs u-margin-Tm">Our stack</h4>
<p class="para">We have to stay nimble whilst delivering mission-critical code.
  To do so we constantly prioritise keeping both our stack and our codebase
  lean.</p>

<p class="para">We build simple, reliable systems on top of technologies we
  understand and trust. We're primarily built in Ruby and JavaScript, using Ruby
  on Rails and Angular, and we rely on Postgres, Elasticsearch, RabbitMQ and
  Chef.</p>

<p class="para">We deploy many times a day, supported by a test suite we trust
  and a culture of code review.</p>

<h4 class="u-text-h4 u-margin-Bxs u-margin-Tm">What we're looking for</h4>

<p class="para">We're looking for experienced backend software engineers to join
  our growing team. We'd love you to apply if:</p>

<ul class="list">
  <li>
    You have a passion for technology and care deeply about doing work you're proud of.
  </li>
  <li>
    You have strong opinions about programming languages, and 3+ years experience
    building applications for the web.
  </li>
  <li>
    You have an awareness of the full web stack. You live and breathe HTTP, feel
    comfortable optimising SQL queries, and have at least experimented with
    JavaScript.
  </li>
  <li>
    You demand that code be well-tested, and believe that tests are a helpful
    tool in driving design.
  </li>
</ul>
